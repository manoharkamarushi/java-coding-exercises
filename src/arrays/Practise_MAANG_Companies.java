1. Search for a target element in a sorted array. (Binary Search in a Sorted Array)
2. Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s(Approach: Dutch National Flag Algorithm)
3. Find the kth Largest Element (Approach: Quickselect)
4. Merge Overlapping Intervals (Approach: Sort and merge)
5. Find the Peak Element (Approach: Binary Search on Neighbours)

Dynamic Programming Problems
----------------------------
6.  Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) Approach: DP with Binary Search Optimization.
7.  Coin Change Problem  [Approach: DP for Minimum Coins]
8.  Maximum Sum of a Subarray [Technique: Kadane's Algorithm.]
9.  0/1 Knapsack Problem [Approach: Bottom-up DP]

Stack & queue
-------------
10. Design a Stack Supporting Push, Pop, and Retrieve Minimum in O(1). [Technique: Use two stacks — one for the elements (stack), and the other for tracking the minimums (minStack)]
11. Find the Median of a Stream of Integers. [Approach: Use two heaps: Max-Heap: To store the smaller half of the numbers.Min-Heap: To store the larger half of the numbers.]
12. Determine if a Sequence of Brackets is Balanced [Approach: Use a stack to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket.]


**Recap:**
Stack with Minimum Retrieval: Use two stacks to track elements and the minimums.
Median of Stream: Use a max-heap and min-heap for dynamically balancing the numbers.
Balanced Brackets: Use a stack to match opening and closing brackets.
